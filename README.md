Stock Prediction But Done Better


Disclaimer: This application is not financial advise, this is just a fun Machine Learning Project



Welcome to StockNN, a stock predictor made using Neural Networks:

- Using the brilliant TensorFlow and SciKit Learn libraries, we have made a stock predictor that predicts the closing price of a stock one day ahead
- How it works:
  
Pick two dates from where you want the Neural Network to train it's data on, my reccomendation is to start at the First of January, 2012, but you can pick any you want. For the ending date, you may leave it as it is or push it up. It's all up to preference
