Stock Prediction But Done Better


Disclaimer: This application is not financial advise, this is just a fun Machine Learning Project



Welcome to StockNN, a stock predictor made using Neural Networks:

- Using the brilliant TensorFlow and SciKit Learn libraries, we have made a stock predictor that predicts the closing price of a stock one day ahead
- How it works:
  
Pick two dates from where you want the Neural Network to train on, my reccomendation is to start at the First of January, 2012, but you can pick any you want. For the ending date, you may leave it as it is or push it up.There is not really a set of rules to determine over which date period will yield the "closest" results, from my own observations, 1/1/12 to 1/1/20 has worked the best, it is all up to preference and honestly you could just experiment with it(if you find a better training, please let us know):

Next pick a ticker symbol for a company, whose closing stock you would like to predict and then hit submit:

Once you hit submit, you will have to wait a few mins for the Neural Network to train on the data(I will cover how we acquired said data later) and to also make the prediction for the next closing day price:
